    <H1>Jokes</H1>
<p>Hello there! I love a good joke, and there are some really good ones out there!
    For almost every holiday, my mom sends me a card in the mail with jokes. 
    Sometimes she prints out a whole list of them from there internet, and sometimes she 
    hand-writes one inside or on the back. If you ever read one of her jokes, 
    you'll know they're as corny as they can get. So, I've chosen to compile a list of 
    some of the jokes my mother has told me... repeatedly... annually... Some of these
    really could use their own holiday because they come back every year.
</p>

<div class="halloween">
    The most popular joke holiday for my mom is Halloween. 
    She always sends out a long printed list of jokes for this holiday.
    And an email...and then tells them in person...and they're usually the same every year.
<ul>
    <li>Why are skeletons so calm?</li>
        <li>Because nothing gets under their skin.</li>
    <li>Why do skeletons hate the cold?</li>
        <li>It sends chills up their spine.</li>
    <li>Why didn't the skeleton rob the bank?</li>
        <li>Because he didn't have the guts.</li>
    <li>How does a vampire start a letter?</li>
        <li>Tomb it may concern,</li>
</ul>

<div class="spring">
    In honor of the spring season, here are some corny jokes associated with popular springtime themes.
    <ul>
        <li>What do you get when you cross a bunny with an onion?</li>
            <li>A bunion.</li>
        <li>How can you tell which rabbits are getting old?</li>
            <lil>Look for the gray hares.</lil>
        <li>Does February like March?</li>
            <li>No, but April May.</li>
        <li>What did the tree say during springtime?</li>
            <li>"Well, this is a re-leaf!"</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="winter">
    It may be springtime in Minnesota but there's still snow on the ground! <i>Well...</i>
        <ul>
            <li>...we have a new season...</li>
                <li>sprinter.</li>
            <li>Why was the little snowman sad?</li>
                <li>Cuase he had a meltdown.</li>
